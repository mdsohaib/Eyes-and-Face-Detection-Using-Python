  <h2> <i> Face  and EYE Detection App </i> </h2>
<p><i> Face and EYE detection is one of the most challenging problems in disciplines such as image processing,
pattern recognition and computer vision. With the improvements in information technology,
face detection / recognition has wide usage in applications such as personal identity, video
surveillance, witness face reconstruction, computerized aging, control systems  </p>

<br>


  
<br><br>


<p><i> For Face detection App there are many ways to implement this and for various You could build a model from scratch and train of lots of images that have faces, or you could use a pretrained model and work on images. We will be using Haar cascade classifier that are based on machine learning approach.</p>
